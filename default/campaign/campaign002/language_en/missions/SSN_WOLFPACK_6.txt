[MISSION WIN]
My personal congratulations to commanding officer <PLAYERNAME> and crew for delivering this crucial blow to enemy naval forces. It is an honor to serve as your commander. Will see to it that we, crew and all, will have a drink when <PLAYERVESSELNAME> hits the beach.
[MISSION FAIL]
Discouraged to hear you lost this opportunity against such a high priority target. The presence of this enemy will doubt continue to pose a major threat to our ships in the region.
[MISSION MISSED]
Disappointed to hear target was not intercepted. Enemy submarines reported to be operating unhindered in the region.
